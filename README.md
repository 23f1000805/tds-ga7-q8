# Patient Satisfaction ‚Äî 2024 Quarterly Analysis & Data Story

**üìß Analysis by:** [23f1000805@ds.study.iitm.ac.in](mailto:23f1000805@ds.study.iitm.ac.in)

## Executive summary

This analysis examines Patient Satisfaction Scores for 2024 (quarterly). The quarterly values and required summary metrics are below.

* **Q1:** 2.70
* **Q2:** 0.11
* **Q3:** 8.45
* **Q4:** 7.91
* **Average (required): 4.79**
* **Industry Target:** 4.5

**Primary conclusion:** The annual average (4.79) exceeds the industry target (4.5) thanks to strong recovery in Q3‚ÄìQ4; however, the extreme volatility (very low Q2) exposes operational risks that must be mitigated.
**Required solution (per brief):** **improve service quality and wait times**

---

## Key findings

1. **Volatility is the main story.** Q2 collapsed to 0.11 while Q3 and Q4 rebounded strongly (8.45 and 7.91). The quarterly pattern implies intermittent operational failures rather than a sustained structural problem.
2. **Average > target.** Despite the Q2 drop, the yearly average of **4.79** clears the industry target of **4.5**.
3. **Operational fragility risk.** The Q2 outlier indicates single-point failures (staffing, triage, equipment, or process breakdowns) that can rapidly erode performance and patient trust.
4. **Upside capacity exists.** Q3‚ÄìQ4 performance demonstrates the organization can consistently exceed target when systems run smoothly.

---

## Business implications

* **Short-term:** Reputation and patient retention are at risk if Q2-like incidents recur. Even with a positive average, poor quarters create churn and negative word-of-mouth.
* **Mid-term:** Stabilizing operations to avoid deep troughs will convert volatile performance into predictable, above-target outcomes‚Äîimproving referrals and reducing rework cost.
* **Long-term:** Sustained above-target performance enables strategic benefits (better contracting, pricing power, and brand differentiation).

## Recommendations (to achieve and sustain ‚â• 4.5)

**Primary recommendation (required):**

> **Improve service quality and wait times**

Concrete actions:

1. **Service quality**

   * Standardize clinical and customer interaction scripts; implement checklists for key touchpoints (admission, handover, discharge).
   * Launch a short QA program: sample patient-call audits and clinical rounding observations (weekly).
   * Rapidly address recurring detractor reasons from post-visit surveys.

2. **Wait time reduction**

   * Implement demand-driven staffing (hourly arrival forecasts) and a fast-track for low-acuity patients.
   * Introduce virtual queuing and estimated wait-time notifications.
   * Re-engineer front-end triage to remove bottlenecks (parallelize intake tasks where possible).

3. **Resilience & monitoring**

   * Establish a ‚Äúpulse‚Äù dashboard that tracks real-time CSAT by hour/unit and flags sudden drops (early-warning).
   * Define incident playbooks for Q2-like collapses (escalation, temporary staffing pools, rapid communications).

4. **Measure & iterate**

   * A/B test triage scripts, queueing options, and staffing mixes; use cohort analysis to attribute lift.
   * Set a goal of reducing quarter-to-quarter volatility (standard deviation) by 30% within 3 quarters.
