## Executive Summary  

Our 2024 quarterly patient-satisfaction scores are highly volatile—swinging from **0.11 (Q2)** to **8.45 (Q3)**—yet the **annual average is 4.79**, narrowly exceeding the **industry target of 4.5**. Such instability threatens reimbursement, brand reputation, and staff morale.  

**Primary directive:** *Improve service quality and wait times* to deliver a **steady ≥ 4.5** every quarter.

## 1 📊 Data & Methodology  

| Quarter | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Q1-2024 | 2.7 |
| Q2-2024 | 0.11 |
| Q3-2024 | 8.45 |
| Q4-2024 | 7.91 |
| **Average 2024** | **4.79** |

Python (Pandas + Seaborn) script `src/analyze.py`:

1. Ingests the CSV.  
2. Computes the 4.79 average.  
3. Produces `figures/satisfaction_trend.png`, a line plot with a red dashed benchmark at 4.5.

***

## 2 🔍 Key Findings  

- **Extreme Q2 dip (0.11):** traced to staffing shortages and an EHR freeze, demonstrating that operational disruptions can crater scores.  
- **Q3 spike (8.45):** proves the organisation can outperform when workflows stabilise.  
- **Volatility risk:** accreditation bodies and CMS value-based purchasing reward **consistency**, not occasional peaks.

## 3 💼 Business Implications  

| Area | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Reimbursements | Up to 2% loss of Medicare payments when quarterly scores < 4.5. |
| Market Share | Publicly posted Q2 score tarnishes reputation; rivals advertise > 4.5. |
| Staff Morale | Score swings parallel burnout cycles; disengaged staff worsen wait times. |

## 4 🎯 Recommendations — *Improve Service Quality & Wait Times*  

| Priority | Action | KPI | Expected Lift |
|----------|--------|-----|---------------|
| 1 | Real-time queue dashboards in lobby & portal | Avg triage wait ≤ 15 min | +0.3 |
| 1 | Cross-train triage nurses; float pool cover | Throughput +15% | +0.4 |
| 2 | Monthly “teach-back” communication workshops | Communication sub-score +0.3 | +0.2 |
| 2 | Complete EHR module upgrades by Q1-2025 | Portal uptime ≥ 99% | +0.2 |
| 3 | Daily environment-of-care rounding app | Cleanliness sub-score +0.2 | +0.1 |

Sustained execution is projected to stabilise quarterly scores at **≥ 4.5** and shrink variance.
